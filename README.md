# C++ Notes & Problem Solving

Welcome! This repository is a personal space where I document my journey with C++, including:

* ðŸ“’ Notes on C++ syntax, STL, templates, and modern best practices.
* ðŸ§  Problem-solving solutions from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.
* ðŸ’¡ Common algorithms and data structures with clean, reusable implementations.

## Goals

* Keep track of my learning progress
* Build a reusable collection of templates and patterns
* Sharpen problem-solving skills through consistent practice

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the folders. Each file typically includes:

* Problem statement (if applicable)
* My solution with comments
* Related C++ concepts or STL usage
